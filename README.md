# Setup

1. Load the files onto your raspberry pi or other linux box (Not officially supported)
2. Run `install.sh`
3. Follow prompts



# Notes

* Default username and password is `Admin` and `nimda`
  * Currently no good way of changing this. That will be coming soon. For now just change it in `api.py`
* The domain for the box will default to `admin.cyp`. **DO NOT CHANGE THIS**. A way to do so will be coming later
* Make sure your DNS is set to the private IP of the box you are setting this up on.
